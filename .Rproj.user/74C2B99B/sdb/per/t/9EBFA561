It is the [6th leading cause of death in the US](https://www.alz.org/facts/), and it [does not have a cure](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_treatments.asp). The latter fact strongly affects a family of a newly diagnosed with AD patient. Exploring the landscape of ongoing clinical trials, targeting AD, is the next step family takes to assess possible treatment options. [Clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov) is a database of clinical studies conducted around the world and is a great place to start exploring experimental treatment possibilities. It has user friendly interface and provides extensive amount of clinical trials information. However, it could be overwhelming for someone without special training to dive through tabulated extensive information available at [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov). \nA web-based visualization tool, which summaries Alzheimer`s Disease clinal trial information while sourcing data from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov), could be a useful tool for those families, impacted by the illness and seeking a quick visual reference guide on Alzheimers Disease clinical trials past and present research.  \n\n\n# Data and methods   \nThe data were obtained by downloading all results associated with a search for \"alzheimer\" on the website clinicaltrials.gov. Data were accessed on 11/09/2017. All studies associated with the search term were included regardless of whether the study had previously completed, terminated, or other enrollment status factors. The data used in analyses are available in the `data` file on the github page and the primary datafile used in analysis is called `SearchResultsTable.csv`. \n\nAdditional variables of interest were obtained by downloading all the data from each webpage associated with all studys returned in the original \"alzheimer\" search.

An additional dataset called `alzheimers_data` containing all variables associated with each study identified during the \"alzheimer\" search. \n\nThe datasets `SearchResultsTable.csv` and `alzheimers_data` contain largely overlapping variables. The dataset `SearchResultsTable.csv` is generally more processed, particularly for natural language variables. However, `alzheimers_data` contains several variables not available in `SearchResultsTable.csv` that an interested future researcher may access. \n\n\n## Summary statistics [Faith/Volha?]  \n\n```{r load_data}\ndata = \n  read_csv(\"../Data/SearchResultsTable.csv\") %>%\n  clean_names() \n\n# Create dataset for descriptives for clinical trials in the US\nus_studies = data %>%\n  # Filter only studies that have sites in the United States\n  filter(str_detect(locations, \"United States\"))  %>%\n         # Count number of locations, interventions, and funders\n  mutate(num_locs = as.numeric(str_count(locations, \"\\\\|\")) + 1,\n         num_intervs = as.numeric(str_count(interventions, \"\\\\|\")) + 1,\n         num_funders = as.numeric(str_count(funded_bys, \"\\\\|\")) + 1,\n         # Dummy for Funded by - \"Industry\"\n         fundby_industry = ifelse(str_detect(funded_bys, \"Industry\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         # dummy for Funded by - \"NIH\"\n         fundby_nih = ifelse(str_detect(funded_bys, \"NIH\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         # dummy for FUnded by - \"U.S. Fed\"\n         fundby_usfed = ifelse(str_detect(funded_bys, \"U.S. Fed\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         # dummy for Funded by - \"Other\")\n         fundby_other = ifelse(str_detect(funded_bys, \"Other\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         # Intervention Types -- Dummy Variables\n         interv_drug =  ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Drug:\") == TRUE, 1, 0), \n         interv_behav = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Behavioral:\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         interv_biol  = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Biological:\") == TRUE, 1, 0), \n         interv_diag  = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Diagnostic Test:\") == TRUE, 1, 0) ,\n         interv_device = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Device:\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         interv_rad   = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Radiation:\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         interv_diet  = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Dietary Supplement:\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         interv_gene  = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Genetic:\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         interv_proc  = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Procedure:\") == TRUE, 1, 0),\n         interv_other = ifelse(str_detect(interventions, \"Other:\") == TRUE, 1, 0))\n\n# This data contains the variable on number of US Sites \nnum_ussites = readRDS(\"../Data/num_ussites.rds\")\n\n```\n\nThe main datasetcontained  **`r format(nrow(data), nsmall = 1, big.mark = \",\")` records** corresponding to all studies on Alzheimer's Disease registered at the [ClinicalTrials.gov website](http://clinicaltrials.gov) with study start dates from `r data %>% pull(start_date) %>% min()` to `r data %>% pull(start_date) %>% max()`.
