Across boroughs, restaurants appear to have similar ratios of the frequency of inspection grades, although Staten Island may have an increased proporation of \"B\" grades when compared with other boroughs. Additional hypothesis testing would be needed to confirm if this is a statistically significant increase.\n\nTime series plots showing the inspection score over time demonstrate substantial instability in inspection score over time. Baseline inspection score does not appear to predict future inspection score.\n\n### Links:\nVisualizations of these results, source code, and the datasets used in these analyses are available at the links below. \n\n* The link to our flex_dashboard for Problem 1 is [here](https://ijeasthausen.github.io/p8105_hw6_ije2103/hw6_flexdashboard.html).\n\n* The link to our shiny-enabled dashboard for Problem 2 is [here](https://ijeasthausen.shinyapps.io/p8105_hw6_shiny_nyc_rest_insp/).\n\n* The link to our GitHub repo that underlies our Problem 1 dashboard and the webpage is [here](https://github.com/ijeasthausen/p8105_hw6_ije2103).\n\n* The link to our GitHub repo that underlies our Problem 2 dashboard is [here](https://github.com/meoak/p8105_hw6_shiny_nyc_rest_insp).\n\n*NOTE:  The aforementioned links may also be found on the navigation bar at the top of this page.*",
